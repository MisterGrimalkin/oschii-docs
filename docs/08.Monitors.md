# Monitors

A Monitor watches other components for changes and/or polls them at regular intervals. Monitors are intended
to be able to watch any type of component whose value can change, but are currently limited to Sensors.
A single Monitor can watch multiple Sensors.

Monitors are defined by JSON objects in a top-level array called `"Monitors"`.

Monitors support Conditions, Message Builders, Value Transforms, and Subs. They can send messages to
other components, but not receive them.

### JSON Definition

| Property        | Description                                                  | Value            | Default                             |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `onChange`      | Activate Monitor on change                                   | Boolean          | true                                |
| `pollInterval`  | Activate Monitor every this many milliseconds                | integer          | 0 (do not poll)                     |
| `trigger`       | Changes in this component cause Monitor to activate          | string           |                                     |
| `triggers`      | Changes in any of these components cause Monitor to activate | Array of strings |                                     |
| `messageSource` | Source component for Monitor base message                    | strings          | If not set, first `trigger` is used |

NOTE: In future versions of Oschii, the keys `trigger` and `triggers` will be made interchangeable, same as `target`
and `targets`. For now they are not.

### Operation

On each system cycle a Monitor performs various checks to see if it should *activate* or not. First it evaluates its
Condition (if set). If the Condition passes, a Monitor with a `pollInterval` will check if that many milliseconds have
passed since the last activation, and a Monitor with `onChange` set to `true` will check the "changed" status of its
`trigger` components. If, for either reason, the Monitor decides it should activate, the message from the
`messageSource` component (default being the first `trigger`) is passed through its Message Builder and Value Transform
(if set) and then passed into each of its Subs.

Each Sub then evaluates its own Condition, Message Builder, and Value Transform, and passes its generated message
to its `target` component(s).

If any `target` components are defined on the parent Monitor, they are added to the `target` set of each Sub.
A Monitor itself never sends messages, only its Subs do.

### Example 1

This Monitor is activated when two Touch Sensors are both pressed. A change in either
Sensor will cause the Monitor to evaluate its Condition, and if it passes send one message to a Driver
and another to a Reporter.

```json
{
  "Reporters": [
    {
      "name": "Colin",
      "ip": "192.168.1.203"
    }
  ],
  "Sensors": [
    {
      "name": "Touch1",
      "type": "touch",
      "pin": 4,
      "offValue": 0
    },
    {
      "name": "Touch2",
      "type": "touch",
      "pin": 5,
      "offValue": 0
    }
  ],
  "Drivers": [
    {
      "name": "LED",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 18
    }
  ],
  "Monitors": [
    {
      "name": "DoubleTouch",
      "triggers": [
        "Sensor:Touch1",
        "Sensor:Touch2"
      ],
      "condition": {
        "and": [
          { "if": "Sensor:Touch1", ">": 0 },
          { "if": "Sensor:Touch2", ">": 0 }
        ]
      },
      "Subs": [
        {
          "message": [ 100, 1000, 2000 ],
          "target": "Driver:LED"
        },
        {
          "message": [ 255 ],
          "target": "Reporter:Colin/double_touch"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2

This Monitor activates on changes in any of three infrared ranging sensors (Analog Sensors),
and sends a message consisting of the values from each of them to a Reporter. This is intended
to create a dynamic 8-bit RGB message controlled by the Sensors.

```json
{
  "Reporters": [
    {
      "name": "MaxDisplay",
      "ip": "192.168.1.111"
    }
  ],
  "Sensors": [
    {
      "name": "IR0",
      "type": "analog",
      "pin": 16,
      "valueTransform": {
        "inputRange": "12-bit",
        "outputRange": "8-bit"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "IR1",
      "type": "analog",
      "pin": 17,
      "valueTransform": {
        "inputRange": "12-bit",
        "outputRange": "8-bit"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "IR2",
      "type": "analog",
      "pin": 18,
      "valueTransform": {
        "inputRange": "12-bit",
        "outputRange": "8-bit"
      }
    }
  ],
  "Monitors": [
    {
      "name": "RGB",
      "triggers": [
        "Sensor:IR0",
        "Sensor:IR1",
        "Sensor:IR2"
      ],
      "message": [
        "Sensor:IR0",
        "Sensor:IR1",
        "Sensor:IR2"
      ],
      "target": "Reporter:MaxDisplay/set_rgb"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that we're not explicitly defining any Subs here. Oschii will automatically create a single Sub in this case.
