# Messages

Components within an Oschii configuration communicate with each other, and with the network, using *messages*. Some
types of component generate their own messages, others only respond to messages they receive.

An Oschii message is a zero-indexed list of values. Values within a message are called *arguments*, and these may be 
integers, decimal numbers, or strings. In this documentation messages are written as JSON arrays.

The following message contains three arguments, one of each type:

```json
[42, 4.2, "Seven times Eight"]
```

We refer to individual arguments using their index preceded by a dollar sign, so `$0` in the above message is the
integer `42`, and `$2` is the string `"Seven times Eight"`.

It is worth noting here that **every component contains exactly one message**. This may be a message it has generated
or the last message it received. Any component can refer to the current message of any other component.

### OSC

Oschii messages are basically the same as OSC messages. If an Oschii configuration defines a network Listener called
`MyLovelyListener` which expects two integer arguments, send the following command using CommsKit or similar:

```
/MyLovelyListener 65 1000
```

### HTTP

Oschii messages are represented in HTTP requests and responses as JSON arrays. For POST requests this is contained
within the body, for GET requests this is a query parameter called `message`.

If the above Listener is set to respond to HTTP GET requests, you can activate it by entering the following in your
web browser's address bar:

```
http://192.168.1.201/MyLovelyListener?message=[65,1000]
```

### Message Inspection

You can view the messages held by each component (and subcomponent) in the current
configuration by visiting this page:
