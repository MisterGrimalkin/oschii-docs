# I<sup>2</sup>C Keypad Module (Adafruit Trellis HT16K33)

This Module is a keypad with 16 buttons (in a 4x4 grid), each with an LED behind it.

A Keypad module produces a message on each keypress, and accepts messages to control the LEDs.

There are additional JSON properties for this Module:

| Property   | Value   | Default |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `onValue`  | integer | 1       |
| `offValue` | integer | 0       |

These are the values associated with the PRESSED/ON state and the RELEASED/OFF state.

As with binary Sensors, a value of -1 will NOT cause a message to be sent.

### Outgoing Message

The module will send a two-argument message to its `target` component(s) every time a key is pressed.
`$0` is the state of the most recent key event (`onValue` or `offValue`) and `$1` is the key number (1..16).

### Incoming Messages

This module responds to incoming messages to control the LED states. The first argument
determines the action to take, and how the other arguments (if any) are used.

| Argument 0  | Other Arguments             | Meaning                      |
|-------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0           |                             | Switch all LEDs OFF          |
| 0           | **k**                       | Switch LED **k** (1..16) OFF |
| 1           |                             | Switch all LEDs ON           |
| 1           | **k**                       | Switch LED **k** (1..16) ON  |
| 2           | **k1**, **k2**, ... **k16** | (see below)                  |

A message with a first argument of 2 allows all LED states to be updated with a single
message. There should be 16 additional arguments, each corresponding to a key number (1..16).
Each value can be 1 (turn ON), 0 (turn OFF), or -1 (leave unchanged).

### Example

If `onValue` and `offValue` are left to their default values (1 and 0), we can set the module's `target`
to itself to make the LEDs follow the key presses.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```
