# I<sup>2</sup>C GPIO Module (MCP23017)

This Module provides 16 GPIO channels, each of which may be an input or an output. A Sensor or Driver of type
"gpio" can use one of these channels by setting the `i2cModule` 
property and the appropriate `pin` (0..15).

This Module does not support pull-down resistors on the input.

NOTE: The standard breakout board labels the channels in blocks of 8 - A0..A7 and B0..B7, but Oschii references these
as "pins" 0..15 respectively.

The message held by this type of module contains four integers, being the representations
of the two input and two output buffers respectively.

### Incoming Messages

This module is intended for specific use by a Sensor or Driver, but will also respond
to a direct message from another component.

A two argument message will set pin `$0` to value `$1`.

### Example

```json
{
  "I2C": {
    "sdaPin": 4,
    "sclPin": 5,
    "modules": [
      {
        "name": "GPIO-A",
        "type": "gpio",
        "address": "0x20"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
