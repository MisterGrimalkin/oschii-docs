# Touch Sensors

These measure a capacitive touch sensor, and produce a binary ON/OFF output. An integer value can be associated with 
each state, and this is the single argument in the Sensor's message.

Touch Sensors can be connected to metal, fruit, ITO film, etc. and respond to human touch.

You must ensure that nothing is touching the sensor when Oschii starts up. A small set of
samples is taken from the sensor on startup, and this is used (in conjunction with the
`sensitivity` property) to detect touch.

This feature is only available on native pins.

### JSON Definition

If Sensor `type` is `"touch"` the following additional properties are available:

| Property       | Description                                  | Value                  | Default                               |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `pin`          | Pin number (native)                          | integer                | *REQUIRED*                            |
| `sensitivity`  | Higher value means more sensitive            | 0..100                 | 70                                    |
| `onValue`      | Value associated with ON (touched) state     | integer                | 1                                     |
| `offValue`     | Value associated with OFF state              | integer                | -1 (will not trigger "changed" event) |
| `invert`       | Swap ON/OFF behaviour                        | Boolean                | false                                 |
| `bounceFilter` | Ignore subsequent changes for specified time | integer (milliseconds) | 0                                     |
| `holdOnFilter` | Ignore ON state for specified time           | integer (milliseconds) | 0                                     |
