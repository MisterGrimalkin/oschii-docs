# Conditions

A Condition determines if a component should activate when it receives or generates a new Message. Conditions may be
defined on components (and/or on Subs) with a JSON object under the key `condition`.

The Condition is a Boolean expression, evaluating to true (_pass_) or false (_fail_).  It compares a _left expression_
with a _right expression_ using a _comparator_.

Each expression may be a value taken from a component, a value from the incoming Message, or a hard-coded
integer value.

| Property     | Description                                        | Value                            | Default    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| `left`       | Source for left expression                         | integer or string                | 0          |
| `comparator` | How to compare left expression to right expression | "<", "<=", ">", ">=", "==", "!=" | _REQUIRED_ |
| `right`      | Source for right expression                        | integer or string                | 0          |

To reference a component, use the _Component Reference Syntax_ to indicate the component and the specific argument
within its Message (zero-indexed), e.g. `Driver:MyDriver$0`.

To reference an argument from the incoming Message, simply specify the argument index: `$0`

### Short Syntax

For more readable Conditions the key `if` can be used instead of `left`, and the value of `comparator` may be used
in place of `right`.

The following two examples are equivalent, passing only if the third argument of the incoming message is greater than
50:

```json
{
  "name": "MyComponent",
  "condition": {
    "left": "$2",
    "comparator": ">",
    "right": 50
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "MyComponent",
  "condition": {
    "if": "$2",
    ">": 50
  }
}
```

Since whitespace in JSON documents is ignored, we could also write this as:

```json
{
  "name": "MyComponent",
  "condition": { "if": "$2", ">": 50 }
}
```

This condensed syntax is preferred in this documentation.

### Comparators

| Symbol | Meaning                  |
|--------|--------------------------|
| `==`   | Equal to                 |
| `!=`   | Not equal to             |
| `>`    | Greater than             |
| `>=`   | Greater than or equal to |
| `<`    | Less than                |
| `<=`   | Less than or equal to    |

### Combinations

A set of Conditions can be combined with the standard boolean operators:

| Operator | Pass if...                                               |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `and`    | All sub-Conditions pass                                  |
| `or`     | At least one sub-Condition passes                        |
| `xor`    | At least one sub-Condition passes and at least one fails |
| `nand`   | At least one sub-Condition fails                         |
| `nor`    | All sub-Conditions fail                                  |

To use this feature, supply an array of Conditions under one of the keys above. Sub-Conditions can themselves contain 
sub-Conditions.

### Example

Given Sensors called `Button1`, `Button2` and `Button3`, the following example condition will pass if `Button1` is pressed
(i.e. the first argument of its message is greater than zero) OR if `Button2` and `Button3` are BOTH pressed:

```json
{
  "name": "MyComponent",
  "condition": {
    "or": [
      { "if": "Sensor:Button1", ">": 0 },
      { 
        "and": [
          { "if": "Sensor:Button2", ">": 0 },
          { "if": "Sensor:Button3", ">": 0 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### `case` Conditions

It is common to have a condition that checks the value of the first argument of the incoming message, and there is a
special syntax for defining these conditions.

The following example condition passes if the first argument of the incoming message is 1:

```json
{
  "name": "MyComponent",
  "condition": { "if": "$0", "==": 1 }
}
```

And we can write this more simply as:

```json
{
  "name": "MyComponent",
  "case": 1
}
```

This is most useful when defining Subs, for example to route the message coming into a Listener to a different
Driver depending on the first argument:

```json
{
  "name": "MyComponent",
  "subs": [
    {
      "case": 0,
      "target": "Driver:Driver1"
    },
    {
      "case": 1,
      "target": "Driver:Driver2"
    },
    {
      "case": 2,
      "target": "Driver:Driver3"
    }
  ]
}
```

NOTE: Although this syntax is clearly borrowed from various programming languages, it is acceptable (and often useful)
to have multiple Subs using the same value for `case`.
