# Oschii

Oschii firmware for the ESP32 microprocessor is designed for use in immersive theatre, interactive
installations, and home automation. The firmware was created for the Oschii device created by Bailes and Light Ltd.
but should work on any ESP32 dev board.

Oschii can make motors, solenoid locks, pixel strips, audio outputs, etc. easily controllable using standard
network protocols, meaning you can control physical installations from within a Max/MSP or PureData
patch. Oschii can monitor switches, break-beams, touch sensors, distance sensors, etc. and report changes over the
network, helping you to make an immersive environment more responsive to the people in it.

Oschii is also configurable enough to run standalone interactive installations and games.

### Installation

First you will need the Arduino IDE editor with the ESP32 board definitions.
Follow [this guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/) to do that.

Then download and install the Oschii firmware to the `libraries` directory of your Arduino IDE editor, along with
the required libraries listed below.

Create a new sketch with this code:

```
#include <Oschii.hpp>

Oschii oschii;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  oschii.start();
}

void loop() {
  oschii.loop();
}
```

Compile and upload to your ESP32.

NOTE: When you first install and run Oschii on a fresh ESP32 you will see the message 'SPIFFS: mount failed'
and then the device will seem to hang. It's actually formatting the internal
file system, and should continue to load after a minute or so.

### Networking

Oschii supports networking over WiFi and, for boards that support it, wired ethernet. To enable these you must connect
to the ESP32 over a serial connection from the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor, or any other serial client.

NOTE: In your serial client set the line-ending mode to 'NONE'.

To enable wired ethernet, enter the command `start ethernet`.

To enable WiFi, enter the command `start wifi`. Oschii will then prompt you for the SSID (name) and password for your
WiFi network.

In either case, Oschii will remember your preference and re-connect to the same network on next boot.

When Oschii connects to a network it will display its assigned IP address in the serial output. You can also obtain this
by entering the serial command `ip`. You may specify a static IP address in Oschii's settings, though this may not work
on all networks.

Once you have Oschii's IP address, navigate to this address in a web browser connected to the same network and you
should see a simple website showing details of the device and its current configuration. From here you can modify the
device settings and configuration.

### Configuration

Oschii's behaviour is defined in a [JSON document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) which can be edited in Oschii's
web UI.

You can also retrieve the current configuration with a HTTP GET request to `http://[Oschii IP]/config.json` or with the
serial command `config`.

You can upload a new configuration with a HTTP POST request to `http://[Oschii IP]/config` or with the serial
command `config=`.

A configuration consists of **Components** which communicate using **Messages**. This is explained in the rest of this
documentation.

### Settings

The settings page of the web UI allows you to edit some global settings for the device, including its name. In here
you can also enable logging for different component types.

Similarly to the configuration, settings can also be retrieved and updated with HTTP calls (GET `/settings.json` and
POST `/settings`) or with serial commands (`settings` and `settings=`).

If you upload a new settings document which does not include all settings, any settings not included will remain
unchanged.

For example, to update the name of the Oschii and set a static IP address, POST the following to `/settings`:

```json
{
  "name": "Ada",
  "network": {
    "staticIP": "192.168.1.201",
    "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
    "subnet": "255.255.255.0"
  }
}
```

### Required Libraries

You will need to download all of these libraries into the `libraries` directory of your Arduino IDE editor, along with
the Oschii code itself.
