# Components

Components are the building blocks of an Oschii configuration. Different types of component have different functions,
but they all share certain features:

- Every component has a `name` used to refer to it from elsewhere in the configuration
- Every component supports the `enabled` property (default `true`) which allows it to be temporarily switched off
- Every component holds a message (either received or generated) which can be inspected by any other component
- Most components can automatically send newly received/generated messages to one or more `target` components
- [Conditions](03a.Conditions.md) allow some components to guard their operation with a Boolean expression
- [Message Builders](03b.MessageBuilders.md) allow some components to build messages using data from multiple sources
- [Value Transforms](03c.ValueTransforms.md) allow some components to re-scale values and provide some basic mathematical operations

### Component Types

There are nine types of component, and these are divided into four groups:

- Hardware Components
    - [Sensor](04.Sensors.md) (reads data from the hardware)
    - [Driver](05.Drivers.md) (writes data to the hardware)
- Network Components
    - [Listener](06.Listeners.md) (handles incoming network messages)
    - [Reporter](07.Reporters.md) (handles outgoing network messages)
- Logic Components
    - [Monitor](08.Monitors.md) (watches for changes in multiple other components)
    - [State](09.States.md) (stores and manipulates a value)
    - [Timer](10.Timers.md) (delays sending of a message)
- Device Components
    - [I2C](11.I2C.md) (a module connected on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus)
    - [Pixel](12.Pixels.md) (a strand of WS281x addressable RGB LEDs)

### Defining Components

A component is defined by a JSON object inside an array. All objects within the same array become components of the same
type, and the type is determined by the key under which the array is defined.

The following example defines two Sensors and one Driver:

```json
{
  "Sensors": [
    { "name": "MyFirstSensor" },
    { "name": "MySecondSensor" }
  ],
  "Drivers": [
    { "name": "MyOnlyDriver" }
  ]
}
```

NOTE: We are just looking at document structure here, and the above example is not actually a valid configuration.

### Component References

Any component within a configuration can refer to any other component, either for sending messages to a target 
component or reading values from a source component's message. This is achieved with the *Component Reference Syntax*, 
consisting of the component's type and name separated by a colon.

The above components would be referenced as `Sensor:MyFirstSensor`, `Sensor:MySecondSensor`, and `Driver:MyOnlyDriver`.

When reading values from a component's message we can also specify the index of the argument we are interested in. For
example, the message held by a Driver is the last message it received. To inspect the **second** argument of the last
message received by the Driver `MyOnlyDriver` we use the component reference `Driver:MyOnlyDriver$1`. If no argument
index is provided, `$0` (i.e. the first argument) is assumed.

This type of component reference is explained in more detail in the Conditions, Message Builders, and Value Transforms
documentation pages.

### Targets

Many components can send a newly received/generated message to one or more target components. We do this by setting 
the `target` property.

This example defines a Listener called `MyListener` which forwards any incoming network messages to a State called
`MyState`:

```json
{
  "States": [
    { "name": "MyState" }
  ],
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "MyListener",
      "target": "State:MyState"
    }
  ]
}
```

To send to multiple targets:

```json
{
  "States": [
    { "name": "MyFirstState" },
    { "name": "MySecondState" }
  ],
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "MyListener",
      "targets": [
        "State:MyFirstState",
        "State:MySecondState"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Wildcard Targets

We can send a message to **all** components of a particular type by using `*` instead of a component name.

The next example does exactly the same as the previous one:

```json
{
  "States": [
    { "name": "MyFirstState" },
    { "name": "MySecondState" }
  ],
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "MyListener",
      "target": "State:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Target Addresses

When sending messages to a target, some components allow us to specify an *address*. For Reporters this is
used as the OSC address or HTTP path, for Pixel components this is the layer name. For example, to send a message
to the OSC address `/button_was_pressed` on a Reporter called `Ada`, we use a `target` of
`Reporter:Ada/button_was_pressed`.

We can also use the wildcard syntax with addresses. To send to **all** Reporters on the address `/button_was_pressed`,
we use a `target` of `Reporter:*/button_was_pressed`.

### "All Reporters" Shortcut

Since we quite often want to send messages to a particular address on **all** Reporters, there is a shortcut syntax for
this. Instead of `"target": "Reporter:*/hello"` we specify `"*": "hello"`.

### `target` vs `targets` vs `~`

In this documentation, the key `target` is used for a single target string, and `targets` is used for an array
of strings. These are actually interchangeable - either property can be a string or an array of strings. We cannot
use both keys within a single component definition.

We can also use the key `~` in place of either, and we can combine custom targets with the "All Reporters" shortcut.

The following two examples are equivalent, though not all components are shown:

```json
{
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "MyListener",
      "targets": [
        "State:MyState",
        "Driver:MyDriver",
        "Reporter:*/some_address"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "MyListener",
      "~": [
        "State:MyState",
        "Driver:MyDriver"
      ],
      "*": "some_address"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Subcomponents

Some component types support subcomponents (called "Subs") which allow more complex logic and message routing.

A Sub is a component in its own right, and supports Conditions, Message Builders, and Value Transforms.

This feature is currently supported by Listeners, States, and Monitors, and is best explained by example in those
documentation pages.

### Precondition

This property only applies to components with Subs.

If the `precondition` property is `false` (default) then the Subs will be processed in the order they appear, and
each will evaluate its condition (if any) before deciding to activate or not.

If `precondition` is `true` then the Subs will first have all their conditions evaluated, and then those that passed
their conditions will be activated. This means the changes made by one Sub will not affect the conditions of other
Subs within the component.

### A Note on CapiTALizATIon

Keys in a JSON document are conventionally written in `lowerCamelCase`, and Oschii follows this convention throughout.
However, since the Component Reference Syntax **requires** capitalized component types (i.e. `Sensor:...`) the keys for the
component arrays may be written in `UpperCamelCase` instead to keep things neater. So you may use `Sensors` OR `sensors`
for the Sensors array (not both). Component names are case-sensitive, and should not contain spaces.

| `precondition`      | Boolean                   | Evaluate all Subs' conditions before activating the first | false            |

NOTE: Component names will default to the component type and an integer counter, e.g. `Sensor0`, `Sensor1`, `Driver0`, 
etc. Components are processed in the order they appear within the array. You should use custom names. Names are good.
