# Listeners

A Listener exposes an OSC address and/or HTTP endpoint on the network, and converts incoming messages into Oschii
messages. The network address of a Listener is `/NameOfListener`.

Listeners are defined by JSON objects in a top-level array called `"Listeners"`.

Listeners support Conditions, Message Builders, Value Transforms, and Subs. They can both send messages to and 
receive messages from other components.

Quite apart from handling incoming network traffic, Listeners are also useful for encapsulating functionality which
can be called from other components.

### JSON Definition

| Property          | Description                       | Value           | Default                            |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| `osc`             | Accept OSC                        | Boolean         | true                               |
| `httpMethod`      | Accept HTTP with specified method | "get", "post"   | (HTTP only enabled if this is set) |
| `responseMessage` | Message Builder for HTTP response | Message Builder |                                    |

### Operation

When a Listener receives a message, it first evaluates its Condition (if present) and only proceeds if the Condition
passes. The Listener then applies its Message Builder and Value Transform (if present) to create a new message,
potentially using values from the incoming message, and then passes this into its Subs.

Each Sub then evaluates its own Condition, Message Builder, and Value Transform, and passes its generated message
to its `target` component(s).

If any `target` components are defined on the parent Listener, they are added to the `target` set of each Sub.
A Listener itself never sends messages, only its Subs do.

### Response Message

##### (from v1.1.0)

Unlike OSC, HTTP follows a request/response pattern. A Listener using HTTP can define a Message Builder
object to build the response sent back when the Listener is called over HTTP.

This partial example defines a HTTP GET Listener which returns the current values of four buttons:

```json
{
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "ButtonStates",
      "httpMethod": "get",
      "responseMessage": [ "Sensor:Button1", "Sensor:Button2", "Sensor:Button3", "Sensor:Button4" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that although this Listener will also accept OSC, the response builder has no effect with OSC. 

### Example 1

This Listener takes the first value from the incoming message and passes it to the Dimmer Driver `BigLight` with a
fade time of two seconds.

```json
{
  "Drivers": [
    {
      "name": "BigLight",
      "type": "dimmer",
      "zeroCrossPin": 14,
      "outputPin": 27,
      "initialValue": 0
    }
  ],
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "FadeBigLight",
      "message": [ "$0", 2000 ],
      "target": "Driver:BigLight"
    }
  ]
}
```

An incoming message `[ 50 ]` sent to the OSC address `/FadeBigLight` will fade the dimmer to 50% in two seconds.

Note that we're not explicitly defining any Subs here. Oschii will automatically create a single Sub in this case.

### Example 2

This Listener takes a seven-argument message and sends each argument to a different PWM driver.

```json
{
  "Drivers": [
    {
      "name": "Red",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 16
    },
    {
      "name": "Orange",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 17
    },
    {
      "name": "Yellow",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 18
    },
    {
      "name": "Green",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 19
    },
    {
      "name": "Blue",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 21
    },
    {
      "name": "Indigo",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 22
    },
    {
      "name": "Violet",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 23
    }
  ],
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "Rainbow",
      "httpMethod": "get",
      "Subs": [
        {
          "message": [ "$0" ],
          "target": "Driver:Red"
        },
        {
          "message": [ "$1" ],
          "target": "Driver:Orange"
        },
        {
          "message": [ "$2" ],
          "target": "Driver:Yellow"
        },
        {
          "message": [ "$3" ],
          "target": "Driver:Green"
        },
        {
          "message": [ "$4" ],
          "target": "Driver:Blue"
        },
        {
          "message": [ "$5" ],
          "target": "Driver:Indigo"
        },
        {
          "message": [ "$6" ],
          "target": "Driver:Violet"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

An incoming message `[ 100, 0, 100, 0, 100, 0, 100 ]` sent to the OSC address `/Rainbow` will light every other LED to
full brightness and the others to zero.

Since this Listener uses HTTP as well, we can achieve the same result by entering this into the address bar of a web
browser:

`http://192.168.1.201/Rainbow?message=[100,0,100,0,100,0,100]`

### Example 3

This example defines two Listeners.

`/MoveServo` accepts a two-argument message, and sends the second argument to one of three Drivers, depending on the 
value of the first argument.

`/MoveAllServos` accepts a single argument, and sends that argument to all Drivers.

```json
{
  "Drivers": [
    {
      "name": "Servo1",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 16
    },
    {
      "name": "Servo2",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 17
    },
    {
      "name": "Servo3",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 18
    }
  ],
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "MoveServo",
      "Subs": [
        {
          "case": 1,
          "message": [ "$1" ],
          "target": "Driver:Servo1"
        },
        {
          "case": 2,
          "message": [ "$1" ],
          "target": "Driver:Servo2"
        },
        {
          "case": 3,
          "message": [ "$1" ],
          "target": "Driver:Servo3"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "MoveAllServos",
      "target": "Driver:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

We are using `case` Conditions here, which are explained in the [Conditions documentation](03a.Conditions.md).

### Example 4

This Listener controls a simple ON/OFF LED (GPIO Driver). A message `[ 0 ]` will turn the LED off, `[ 1 ]` will turn it
ON, and `[ 2 ]` will cause it to flash repeatedly using an envelope.

```json
{
  "Drivers": [
    {
      "name": "LED",
      "type": "gpio",
      "pin": 19
    }
  ],
  "Listeners": [
    {
      "name": "LEDMode",
      "target": "Driver:LED",
      "Subs": [
        {
          "condition": { "if": "$0", "<": 2 }
        },
        {
          "case": 2,
          "message": [ 1, 0, 500, 0, 0, 500, -1 ]
        }
      ]
    }
      
  ]
}
```

This one may look a little strange because the first Sub doesn't appear to do anything. However, a Sub will inherit
the `target(s)` from its parent, and with no Message Builder it will simply pass on the message it received from its
parent.

If the first argument of the incoming message is less than 2 it will be passed to the Driver `LED`, which is 
what we want. If that argument is equal to 2 then the custom message will be passed to the same target.
