# Timers

A Timer is used to delay the sending of a message. This is useful if an operation
takes some time to complete (for example a sensor that takes a while to produce
a stable reading).

Timers are defined by JSON objects in a top-level array called `"Timers"`.

Timers support Conditions, Message Builders, and Value Transforms, but not
Subs. A Timer can both send and receive messages.

### JSON Definition

| Property           | Description                                      | Value                  | Default |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| `alarm`            | Time to delay sending of message                 | integer (milliseconds) | 0       |
| `restartOnTrigger` | Restart Timer if triggered while already running | Boolean                | false   |

### Incoming Messages

A message with a first argument of 0 will cancel the Timer (if it is running).

Any other message will "fire" the Timer. If the Timer is already running, then the `restartOnTrigger` property
determines whether the Timer is restarted from 0 (`true`) or simply left running (`false`).

Once the Timer has been running for `alarm` milliseconds, it will build and transform a message and
send it to its `target` components, then stop.

NOTE: The Timer's Condition is only evaluated on receiving a new message, not when the alarm time is reached.

### Example 1

This example uses a PIR sensor to switch on a light fixture, then switches it off after one minute.
Every time the PIR is triggered the Timer restarts, so the light will remain on for one minute
after the last trigger.

```json
{
  "Timers": [
    {
      "name": "SwitchOffLight",
      "alarm": 60000,
      "message": [ 0, 1000 ],
      "restartOnTrigger": true,
      "target": "Driver:Light"
    }
  ],
  "Sensors": [
    {
      "name": "PIR",
      "type": "gpio",
      "pin": 16,
      "message": [ 100, 1000 ],
      "targets": [
        "Driver:Light",
        "Timer:SwitchOffLight"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Drivers": [
    {
      "name": "Light",
      "type": "pwm",
      "pin": 32
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2

This example reports the value from an infrared ranging sensor. This sensor takes half a second to
produce a stable reading, so Oschii waits that long after the first change in value to report. This
Timer does not restart on each trigger, since if it did it would never reach its alarm time.

```json
{
  "Reporters": [
    {
      "name": "Max",
      "ip": "192.168.1.80"
    }
  ],
  "Timers": [
    {
      "name": "ReportValue",
      "alarm": 500,
      "message": [ "Sensor:Distance" ],
      "target": "Reporter:Max/distance"
    }
  ],
  "Sensors": [
    {
      "name": "Distance",
      "type": "analog",
      "pin": 18,
      "target": "Timer:ReportValue"
    }
  ]
}
```
